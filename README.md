# Oligomer Soup Sequencing (OLIGOSS)

OLIGOSS is a package for _de novo_ sequencing of linear oligomers from
tandem mass spectrometry data.

Full documentation can be found at: <DOCUMENTATION LINK>

__Note__: proper use of this package requires a good working knowledge of both
the chemistry and analytical methods used to obtain results. It is __not__ a
magic bullet to solve all of your oligomer sequencing needs! Please ensure that
all raw mass spectrometry data input to the package is of good quality. All
results should be checked and validated wherever possible, especially if running
data from a new instrument and / or oligomer class.

## Installation

OLIGOSS is available through Pip (Python Package Index):

```
pip install oligoss --user

```
